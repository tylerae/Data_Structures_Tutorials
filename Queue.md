# Queue 

## Review Stack 

As you already know, a stack is a type of data structure where the elements are catergolrized as "Last in, First Out." Contrary to this is a queue. It is a data structure catagorized as "first in first out." 

## What is a Queue exactly?

Lets think of a resturant. You make an order and it goes into an order queue. Other people have made orders before you and there are some people who made orders after. 
Luckily, the queue ensures that your food is made in the order it came in. After all, there is nothing more fustrating than seeing people who ordered after you get their food first. 

Lets review some syntax. These are the buiding blocks for a queue 

my_queue.append(value) - Add and element to your queue 
value = my_queue[0] // del my_queue[0] - Use these to lines of code to delete an item from the queue. (I.E. Dequeue)
length = len(my_queue) - check the length of a queue 
if len(my_queue) == 0: - check if queue is zero
